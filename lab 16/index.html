                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>I was having a lot of trouble with this lab, and I was unable to figure out how to fix with my partner and WesBot's help. I don't really understand how to link the APIs endpoints and what information to plug into javascript.</p>

        <div id="Problems" class="minor section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I honestly was quite lost during this lab, but I am hoping my section leader can help my partner and I with our issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Reflection" class="minor section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I think I just need to look back on the past few lectures from class and see where my issues are.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Results" class="minor section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>I still need to don more work on this lab, but it will be fixed soon.</p>
