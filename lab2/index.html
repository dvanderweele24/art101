         <h1>Hello World</h1>
		 <div>

		 <P>Hi there! My name is Drew Vander Weele and I am a fourth year theater arts major.
		 I have been working in the world of theater both professionally and academically for
		 eleven years. I am planning on pursuing a professional stage career post 
		 graduation. I have very little experience in the programming and tech world, although
		 my father works with Python for his job. I am very interested in New Media's application 
		 to the live theater experience. My partner is Hailey kafer, who is my roomate and close 
		 friend. We are both actors and theater majors, so we are looking forward to using what we
		 learn in class in our future work.
		 </p>

         <h2>Challenge</h2>
         <p>Lab 2 challenged my partner and I to produce HTML 
         and CSS style for a in progress website.</p>
		 </div>

         <div class="minor-section">
         <h2>Problems</h2>
         <p>The main problems we encountered were code formatting errors, 
         mainly finding out how to add a qualifier to a section that we 
         wanted to edit in CSS.</p>
		 </div>

         <div class="minor-section">
         <h2>Reflection</h2>
         <p>This assignment was a little difficult at the start, for me.
			I had to reformat my brain to work in a completely new way. After
			I became more comfortable with the coding language, this assignment
			became quite enjoyable.</p>
		 </div>

         <div class="minor-section">
         <h2>Results</h2>
		 <p>I completed the assignment to the best of my ability.</p>
