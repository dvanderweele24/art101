			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p>Hi there! My name is Drew Vander Weele and I am a fourth year theater arts major.
			I have been working in the world of theater both professionally and academically for 
			eleven years. I am planning on pursuing a professional stage acting career post
			graduation. I have very little experience in the programming and tech world, although
			my father works with Python for his job. I am very interested in New Media's application
			to the live theater experience. My partner is Hailey Kafer, who is my roomate and close 
			friend. We are both actors and theater majors, so we are looking forawrd to using what we
			learn in class in our future work.<p>
