                 and using Javascript commands to scramble and

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had issues creating new files and linking 
                 Javascript and CSS pages. I also had issues with 
                 proper Javascript coding format, but my partner and 
                 I helped each other.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I enjoyed working on this lab, even though I ran 
                 into a couple of road blocks. I really need to work on 
                understanding proper coding formatting.</p>
